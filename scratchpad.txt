I tackled a persistent issue related to unseen labels during the validation process, which was causing errors when training and testing the models. 
I resolved it by mapping unknown labels to a placeholder value, which allowed the training process to continue smoothly. This fix helped me proceed without getting stuck at the label encoding stage.

I also implemented data balancing using `RandomOverSampler` to deal with the class imbalance problem in the dataset. Additionally, I added hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model using `GridSearchCV` to optimize performance.
For the transformer model, I increased the number of training epochs to help improve accuracy.

After these adjustments, both models were successfully trained and evaluated, although the accuracy is still quite low—there’s definitely more work to be done to improve their performance. 
I'll need to explore further feature engineering, better data preparation, or even tweaking model architectures.

Also... I'm keeping the model on my local machine. It's too large to commit to the repo and I nuked my branch in the attempt to push it lol

Next steps:
- Dive deeper into feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Investigate alternative models or architectures that might be better suited for this type of classification task.
- Potentially augment the dataset to improve the quality of training data for the transformer model.
